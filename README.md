# BattleSnake - Lawrence Zhang

Simple BattleSnake coded in Python. Not the most efficient or elegant solution but should do alright.

The AI mainly uses A* To both stall, and find food as quick as possible. By mixing these two combinations the snake will be able to always be on the verge of starving, maximizing the time it can spend on the board.



Designed for Chicago-CSTA Battlesnake Competition
